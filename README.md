# Statistics-Calculator
Class that calculates Mean and Standard Deviation 

Implementing a statistics class in Java with methods to calculate Mean and Standard Deviation is vital for software engineering as it encapsulates fundamental statistical operations within a reusable and maintainable structure. The mean provides a central tendency measure, crucial for summarizing datasets and identifying trends, while the standard deviation quantifies data dispersion, highlighting variability.

In software engineering, applications often handle large datasets from diverse domains like finance, healthcare, or machine learning. By integrating these statistical methods into a dedicated class, developers can streamline data analysis processes, improve code readability, and ensure consistency across projects. Encapsulation of these functionalities allows for better abstraction, enabling modifications or enhancements without affecting the broader application logic.

Furthermore, a well-designed statistics class aligns with software engineering principles like DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) and modularity. Reusable methods reduce redundant code, facilitating testing and debugging. These statistical computations also empower decision-making in areas like algorithm optimization, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling.

Incorporating this functionality into a class prepares applications to handle real-world challenges, such as data preprocessing or feature extraction, with greater efficiency. Overall, it supports the creation of robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems while addressing critical analytical needs.
